Weather App 🌤️ (PyQt5 Project)

This repository contains my first desktop weather application built with Python and PyQt5.
It fetches and displays a 5-day weather forecast using the OpenWeatherMap API, with a clean UI design and real-time updates.

🌱 What I Learned
Python (Core Programming)

Writing clean, modular code with functions and classes.

Handling errors with try/except for better stability.

Using string formatting and data parsing (JSON).

PyQt5 (GUI Development)

Designing responsive desktop layouts with QVBoxLayout.

Customizing widgets with CSS-like styles.

Handling user actions using the signal-slot system.

API Integration

Making HTTP requests with the requests library.

Parsing JSON responses to extract weather data.

Managing API keys securely.

Handling different HTTP errors (401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, etc.).

UI/UX Design

Clean and minimalist interface with a consistent color scheme.

Proper spacing, alignment, and typography for readability.

Using weather emojis ☀️🌧️❄️ for intuitive visual feedback.

⚡ Features in this project

A modern PyQt5 desktop app.

5-day forecast with temperatures and conditions.

Responsive UI that adjusts to window resizing.

Real-time data from OpenWeatherMap API.

Error handling for invalid inputs and network issues.

🏆 Why this project matters

This project is special because it’s my first full PyQt5 desktop application.
It combines:

GUI development

API integration

Error handling

Clean UI design

I now understand how to connect a desktop interface to real-world APIs, handle data safely, and present it in a user-friendly way.

✨ Thanks for checking out my Weather App project!
This is one of the first big steps in my journey to mastering Python and desktop application developme
