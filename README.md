WEATHER APP - PyQt5 Project
Overview
A responsive desktop weather application built with Python and PyQt5 that fetches and displays 5-day weather forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API. This application demonstrates modern GUI development, API integration, and clean UI/UX design principles.

FEATURES
Clean Modern UI: Minimalist design with a cohesive color scheme and appropriate spacing
5-Day Weather Forecast: Displays temperature, conditions, and visual weather indicators
Real-time API Integration: Fetches live weather data from OpenWeatherMap
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling for network issues and invalid inputs
Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes with appropriate scaling
Visual Weather Indicators: Uses emojis to represent different weather conditions intuitively

Technical Skills Demonstrated
Python Programming
Object-oriented programming with classes and methods
Exception handling for robust error management
String formatting and data manipulation

PYQT5 FRAMEWORK
GUI layout management with QVBoxLayout
Widget customization and styling with CSS-like syntax
Event handling with signal-slot connections
Responsive UI design principles

API INTEGRATION
HTTP requests using the requests library
JSON data parsing and extraction
API key management
Handling different HTTP response statuses

SIMPLE UI/UX DESIGN
Consistent color scheme (#ADD8E6 for interactive elements)
Proper alignment and spacing techniques
Typography hierarchy with appropriate font sizes
Interactive elements with hover effects
Visual feedback through weather emojis

Software Architecture
Separation of concerns between UI and business logic

LEARNING OUTCOMES
Desktop Application Development with PyQt5 framework
REST API Integration and data handling
Exception Handling and application robustness
Code Organization and maintainability practices

CONCLUSION
This weather application represents my first comprehensive project using PyQt5, where I successfully integrated several important programming concepts such as
implementing robust error handling for various HTTP status codes including 404 (Not Found), 401 (Unauthorized), and other potential API response errors. This taught me how to properly handle different failure scenarios and provide meaningful feedback to users. then created responsive desktop interfaces with proper widget layout management, styling with CSS-like syntax, and event-driven programming patterns. along with processing JSON responses from the API, extracting relevant weather information, and presenting it in a user-friendly format with appropriate visual indicators (weather emojis). I designed the application with separation of concerns, keeping UI logic distinct from business logic and API communication, which resulted in maintainable and testable code. this project served as an excellent introduction to building practical desktop applications with Python, combining API integration, error handling, and user interface design into a cohesive, functional application.
