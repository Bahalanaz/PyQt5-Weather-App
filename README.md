# Weather App üå§Ô∏è

A responsive desktop weather application built with Python and PyQt5 that fetches and displays 5-day weather forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API.  
This project demonstrates modern GUI development, API integration, and clean UI/UX design principles.

## üå± What I Learned

### Python (Core Programming)
- How to write modular code with functions and classes.
- How to handle errors with `try/except`.
- How to parse and format JSON data.

### PyQt5 (GUI Development)
- How to design layouts with `QVBoxLayout`.
- How to style widgets using CSS-like properties.
- How to handle button clicks and inputs with the signal-slot system.

### API Integration
- How to make requests with the `requests` library.
- How to extract data from JSON responses.
- How to handle errors like **401 Unauthorized** and **404 Not Found**.

### UI/UX Design
- Consistent color scheme (`#ADD8E6` for interactive elements).
- Proper alignment and spacing techniques.
- Typography hierarchy with appropriate font sizes.
- Visual feedback through weather emojis.

## üèÜ Why this project matters
This is my **first comprehensive project using PyQt5**.  
I learned how to combine **API integration, error handling, and user interface design** into a cohesive, functional desktop application.  
It represents a big step forward in building practical applications with Python.
